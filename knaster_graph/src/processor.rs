//! # Audio processor
//!
//! This module contains the [`AudioProcessor`] which is the main entry point for processing audio. It can either be placed in
//! in an [`AudioBackend`], placed in a different audio callback to produce blocks of audio, or manually called in a non-realtime
//! context for non-realtime processing.
